        <h1>Voice Search Survey</h1>
        <p>
          We are conducting research on how people might ask computers for information using speech recognition.
          In this survey, we will show you a number of scenarios that will ask you to use your microphone to ask for something described on the screen.
          We will not tell you what to say, but we would like you to express what you want in your own words.
        </p>

            This survey has two parts.
            First, there is a tutorial to help you learn the interface.
            Then, we will ask you to submit ten responses using your microphone.
